# Python 3 - Data types guage defines many types of data 

# lets see what types of data can be stored in memory and used in python applications

#  the python programming language defines many types of data for many types of operations.We will look at the most widely used data types.

# As an overview lets enumerate the  most famous and useful python 3 data types  -> we have 
"""
1. Strings 
2. numbers
3. Booleans -
4. Lists 
5. Sets
6. Frozensets -
7. tuples
8. Ranges -
9. Dictionaries
10. None -
"""

# All these data types are built into the programming core and you will see that they are very clearly defined and easy to use 

# One way to classify data types is by whether the objects of a data type can be modified after creation or not -> this is called MUTABILITY or""" IMMUTABILTY""" 

# This leads to two kinds of data types 
# 1. mutable data types which can be modified after creation -> Here we can mention -- Lists, Dictionaries, and sets 
# 2. immutable data types -> which cannot be modified after creation -> Here we have --Strings, Numbers, Tuples

a = 2
a = 4
a = 6
print(a)

# Next -> Strings
